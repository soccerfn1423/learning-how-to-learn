I made this blog to write about the concepts and techniques we've learned in our Coursera course, Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects. I've learned a lot from this course by the University of California, San Diego, and I hope to keep blogging on this subject well after the end of this course.
