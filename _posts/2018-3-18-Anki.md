I first became aware of Anki, the ever-popular open-source spaced repetition flashcard software, back in 2010 after hearing about [Roger Craig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Craig_(Jeopardy!_contestant)), the Jeopardy champion who set the record for the highest single-day earnings ever. Apparently, Craig used Anki to memorize information that was most likely to appear during his run. Following Craig's success, use of Anki became the norm for the tech-savvy Jeopardy contestant. At the time, regardless of the burgeoning interest in the software, I didn't take Anki seriously; I thought it was just an isolated use of spaced repetition software that just so happened to benefit a small sub-section of the population, namely game-show contestants. As a result, I never used it in my daily academic routine. I only got re-introduced to Anki after looking over the "Pre-Med, Med students, Doctors" section in the course navigation sidebar. After becoming re-acquainted and using it for several weeks, I've realized that Anki is great at ingraining knowledge, bit by bit, into my long-term memory and preserving it there for lengthy periods of time, especially if used properly. Although there are paid alternatives such as [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/en/frontpage) that claim to use increasingly advanced spaced repetition algorithms, I haven't had a chance to try them out. So, for now, I recommend trying [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) as it is free, has a diverse selection of shared decks (not to mention private, customizable decks), and has several touted learning benefits that I will discuss in-depth in this post.

The learning benefits I will discuss are with respect to the course content; there may be others that you’ve discovered on your own, which you are free to write about in the comments section below the post. I’ll be examining concepts covered in the lectures, with extraneous research and personal inputs introduced as necessary. In particular, the following concepts will be analyzed: focused and diffuse modes of learning, memory, [chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)), [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)), [interleaving](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-interleaving-effect-mixing-it-up-boosts-learning/), testing, life-long learning and broadening your passions, and learning independently.

Focusing your attention in a familiar thought pattern is easy with Anki. After all, the model the software operates on is spaced repetition. In any given session, you’ll see the same card again and again—spaced out in time intervals that depend on your level of mastery of the flashcard—until you’ve thoroughly mastered its definition or conceptual significance. Once Anki repeats that card after an interval of, say, 10 minutes, you’ll enter the focused mode to recall the familiar thought pattern evoked by that card. But while you’re waiting to be retested on the flashcard you just had, you will be presented with another flashcard that presents a different word or concept. By interspersing cards unique to cards you just encountered, Anki stimulates divergent, unfamiliar thought patterns and neural pathways that are more scattered and variegated. I used words like “unique,” “scattered,” and “variegated” here, for although the cards should differ from one another, they should not be wholly unrelated. Unless you’re memorizing something like [GRE vocabulary](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2430987595), they should converge into several umbrellas of terms that then coalesce into a particular, broad subject. By drawing from this broad pool of terms and testing you on it, Anki should make you enter the diffuse mode every time it prompts you with a new, unseen, unique card.

A point of contention with my assertion about the diffuse mode may be that, according to the lectures, wouldn’t the diffuse mode only be induced when you are in a relaxed state of mind, and not when engaging in a review session? I beg to differ, for although the lectures and quizzes stress this point, [Dr. Oakley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Oakley) has herself conceded in _A Mind for Numbers_ that “sometimes you may also flicker for a rapid moment to diffuse mode thinking,” going further to state that “as long as the focused attention is shifted away from the area of interest,” the diffuse mode seems to be elicited. In essence, then, every micro-cycle of familiar to unfamiliar flashcard should prod the mind to “flicker” between the focused and diffuse modes. I'll further argue that, from my own experience, the length of time spent in the diffuse mode need not be limited to a “rapid moment,” but rather depends on how long you spend recalling the meaning of each unfamiliar flashcard. For example, you may spend over 30 seconds on an unfamiliar card, actively searching through broad swathes of your memory for some clue to its meaning. Spending more time on unfamiliar cards is not necessarily bad: it forces you to step away from the main body of familiar cards and ponder, for however long you deem reasonable, the meaning of that morsel of information yet to be assimilated into your knowledge. In the process, you are actively seeking out information that is well beyond the rigid framework of ideas that has thus far characterized your understanding of the material. The implications of such an approach are profound: continue to do Anki sessions regularly, and you will let the software reinforce the “brick-and-mortar” foundations for learning in your desired subject. The importance of enough "mortar" cannot be stressed enough; it is this crucial element that binds together the various constituents of our understanding. In this analogy, the familiar flashcards, or “bricks,” are the focused mode, while the unfamiliar flashcards, or “mortar,” are the diffuse mode. Regardless of what subject you decide to review with Anki, be sure to recognize and embrace this dualistic interaction between focused and diffuse modes of learning; it will allow to optimize your performace on the cards and solidify your understanding.

On a related note, some advice I suggest for you when customizing the settings for a shared or customized deck is to toggle the “bury related cards until the next day” option. Doing so will prevent the re-occurrence of related cards that test the same definition or concept in the current session. Especially for shared decks with related cards that test the same concept in two different formats (e.g. question-answer format and answer-question format), this option will ensure that you don’t encounter two related flashcards too close to one another. Having said this, I think it’s time to move on to the next benefit of Anki.
