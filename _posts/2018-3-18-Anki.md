I first became aware of Anki, the open-source spaced repetition flashcard software, back in 2010 after hearing about [Roger Craig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Craig_(Jeopardy!_contestant)), the Jeopardy champion who set the record for the highest single-day earnings ever. Apparently, Craig used Anki to memorize information that was most likely to appear during his memorable run. Following Craig's success, use of Anki became the norm for the tech-savvy Jeopardy contestant. At the time, regardless of the burgeoning interest in the software, I didn't take Anki seriously; I thought it was just an isolated use of spaced repetition software that just so happened to benefit a small sub-section of the population, namely game-show contestants. As a result, I never used it in my daily academic routine. I only got re-introduced to Anki after looking over the "Pre-Med, Med students, Doctors" section in the course navigation sidebar. After becoming re-acquainted and using it for several weeks, I've realized that Anki is great at ingraining knowledge, bit by bit, into my long-term memory and preserving it there for lengthy periods of time, especially if used properly. Although there are paid alternatives such as [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/en/frontpage) that claim to use increasingly advanced spaced repetition algorithms, I haven't had a chance to try them out. So, for now, I recommend trying [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) as it is free, has a diverse selection of shared decks (not to mention private, customizable decks), and has several touted learning benefits that I will discuss in-depth in this post.

The learning benefits I'll discuss are with respect to the course content; there may be others that you’ve discovered on your own, which you are free to write about in the comments section below the post. I’ll be examining concepts covered in the lectures, with extraneous research and personal inputs introduced as necessary. In particular, the following concepts will be analyzed: 

- focused and diffuse modes of learning

- [chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology))

- independent learning

- [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method))

 - [interleaving](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-interleaving-effect-mixing-it-up-boosts-learning/)
 
- testing

- life-long learning and broadening your passions

## Focused and Diffuse Modes of Learning
Focusing your attention in a familiar thought pattern is easy with Anki. After all, the model the software operates on is spaced repetition. In any given session, you’ll see the same card again and again—spaced out in time intervals that depend on your level of mastery of the flashcard—until you’ve thoroughly mastered its definition or conceptual significance. Once Anki repeats that card after an interval of, say, 10 minutes, you’ll enter the focused mode to recall the familiar thought pattern evoked by that card. But while you’re waiting to be retested on the flashcard you just had, you will be presented with another flashcard that presents a different word or concept. By interspersing cards that are unique to cards you just encountered, Anki stimulates divergent, unfamiliar thought patterns and neural pathways that are more scattered and variegated. I used words like “unique,” “scattered,” and “variegated” here, for although the cards should differ from one another, they should not be wholly unrelated. Unless you’re memorizing something like [GRE vocabulary](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2430987595), they should converge into several umbrellas (or "chunks") of terms that then coalesce into a particular, broad subject. By drawing from this broad pool of terms and testing you on it, Anki should cause you to enter the diffuse mode every time it prompts you with a unseen, unique card.

A point of contention with my assertion about the diffuse mode may be that, according to the lectures, wouldn’t the diffuse mode only be induced when you are in a relaxed state of mind, and not when engaging in a review session? I disagree, for although the lectures and quizzes stress this point, [Dr. Oakley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Oakley) has herself conceded in _A Mind for Numbers_ that “sometimes you may also flicker for a rapid moment to diffuse mode thinking,” going on further to state that “as long as the focused attention is shifted away from the area of interest,” the diffuse mode seems to be elicited. In essence, then, every micro-cycle of familiar to unfamiliar flashcard should prod the mind to “flicker” between the focused and diffuse modes. I'll further argue that, from my own experience, the length of time spent in the diffuse mode need not be limited to a “rapid moment,” but rather depends on how "long the focused attention is shifted away" from the familiar cards. For example, you may spend over 30 seconds on an unfamiliar card, actively searching through broad swathes of your memory for some clue to its meaning. And spending more time on unfamiliar cards is not necessarily bad: it forces you to step away from the main body of familiar cards and ponder, for however long you deem reasonable, the meaning of that morsel of information yet to be assimilated into your knowledge. In the process, you are actively seeking out information that is well beyond the [rigid framework of ideas](https://books.google.com/books?id=vsGaBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT145&lpg=PT145&dq=rigid+framework+of+thought+patterns&source=bl&ots=3rl6WWJbWi&sig=gYLTUWvLyqQ1TCgr8B3pa6NGmAM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6wqXN3PPZAhUPd6wKHUjQCuoQ6AEIXjAI#v=onepage&q=rigid%20framework%20of%20thought%20patterns&f=false) that has thus far characterized your understanding of the material. The implications of such an approach are profound: continue to do Anki sessions regularly, and the software will reinforce the “brick-and-mortar” foundations of your learning. The importance of enough "mortar," or diffuse mode thinking, cannot be stressed enough; it is this crucial element that binds together the various constituents of our understanding, through the creative intermingling of disparate thought patterns. In this analogy, the familiar flashcards, or “bricks,” induce the focused mode, while the unfamiliar flashcards, or “mortar,” elicit the diffuse mode. Regardless of what subject you decide to review, be sure to recognize and embrace this dualistic nature of the focused and diffuse modes of learning; it will allow you to optimize your performace on the cards and solidify your overall understanding. In summary, Anki may very well be a synthetic, algorithm-driven manifestation of traditional, "brick-and-mortar" learning.

On a related note, some advice I suggest for you when customizing the settings for a shared or customized deck is to toggle the [“bury related cards until the next day”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/7jw0mv/should_i_bury_related_new_card_to_next_day/) option. Doing so will prevent the re-occurrence of related cards that test the same definition or concept. Especially for shared decks that test the same concept in two different formats (e.g. question-answer format and answer-question format), this option will ensure that you don’t encounter two related flashcards on the same day. However, be aware that enabling this option will not prevent you from studying cards from the same topic; the importance of reviewing cards from a related, yet broad deck will be emphasized in section devoted to chunking. Having said this, I think it’s time to move on to the next benefit of Anki.

## Chunking
Anki facilitates [chunking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/11/08/what-makes-chunking-such-an-effective-way-to-learn/#5ccdaf2f60a9) by heavily involving the focused mode of learning. So, what exactly is a chunk? According to Dr. Oakley, a chunk is “a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively.” It is the meaningful neural structure formed when we simplify a set of abstract ideas or an intricate, detailed set of commands into one cohesive concept or seamless action. For the purposes of learning with Anki, I will only discuss the chunking of mental ideas, rather than physical actions. The three-step method of forming a chunk is as follows: focused attention, understanding, and practice. Gradually, by focusing your attention on a particular flashcard, promoting understanding by allowing you to see the official answer and compare it with your answer, and repeatedly testing a flashcard in a spaced interval determined by your level of mastery of that flashcard, Anki ensures you form chunks efficiently and methodically. What Anki avoids in the process of chunking are illusions of competence, particularly those that arise from a momentary grasp of the material but lack of long-term commitment to memory. By spacing out the your recall sessions over the course of several minutes, Anki forces you to remember the concept for a certain word throughout the session. Such intermittent recall is one of the best ways to learn and embed knowledge in your long-term memory, according to research by psychologist [Jeff Karpicke](https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/psy/directory/faculty/Karpicke_Jeffrey.html) published in the Journal Science. Overall, in my opinion, chunking with spaced repetition software like Anki, is one of the central components of learning effectively. Next, I will discuss how libraries of chunks involve, conversely, the diffuse mode of thinking.

## Learning Independently, Deliberate Practice, Interleaving, and Testing
Perhaps the most obvious benefit of Anki is that it allows meaningful, self-directed learning. A typical session lasts 30 to 40 minutes—which, by the way, is perfect for completing a [Pomodoro](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730), which focuses your attention on the task at hand while ignoring distractions and rewarding yourself afterwards. But you can also break up your single review session into briefer sessions that keep your interest stimulated throughout the day. I personally prefer to do one, uninterrupted session in the morning when I am freshest, to get it over with and move on with my day. But if you have time constraints, and the only time you can find is whenever and wherever you have spare time, by all means, go for it. The research, in particular, supports testing in different environments; in Dr. Oakley's "Illusions of Competence" lecture, she states that by learning in various environments, you develop the ability to recall information you studied regardless of where you are at the moment. This fact is key for you to maximize your performance in a test-taking environment, which, unless you've exposed yourself to diverse environments while studying, will affect your ability to recall on exam day. Beyond the flexibility learning independently affords, it also promotes learning that is based on the process rather than the product. As long as we are deeply immersed in the review session, and form a self-perpetuating habit of recalling the meaning of each flashcard, we can curb detriments to learning such as procrastination and goal-oriented thinking. With Anki, forming this good habit is not hard at all. The software, from my experience, is quite addicting, and is even a rudimentary game of sorts. The simple interface, the clickable buttons that allow you rate how well you know each flashcard, and especially the useful, downloadable add-ons such as [Incremental Reading](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1081195335), [Quizlet Importer](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/590899480), and many, many others, have sustained my interest and enlisted my friendly “zombies” to continue doing Anki review sessions once per day. Overall, independent learning is a cornerstone of Anki.

Anki fosters deliberate practice, interleaving, and testing all with one simple, underlying testing method: active recall. Deliberate practice is the
