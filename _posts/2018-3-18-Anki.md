title: The Benefits of Learning with Anki

I first became aware of Anki, the ever-popular open-source spaced repetition flashcard software, back in 2010 after hearing about [Roger Craig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Craig_(Jeopardy!_contestant)), the Jeopardy champion who set the record for the highest single-day earnings ever on the show. Apparently, Craig used Anki to memorize information that was most likely to appear during his run. Following Craig's success, use of Anki became the norm for some tech-savvy Jeopardy contestants. At the time, regardless of the burgeoning interest in the software, I didn't take Anki seriously; I thought it was just an isolated use of spaced repetition software that just so happened to benefit a small sub-section of the population, namely game-show contestants. As a result, I never used it in my daily academic routine. I only got re-introduced to Anki after casually looking over the "Pre-Med, Med students, Doctors" section in the course navigation sidebar. After becoming re-acquainted and using it for several weeks, I've realized that Anki is great at ingraining knowledge, bit by bit, into my long-term memory and preserving it there for lengthy periods of time, especially if used properly. Although there are paid alternatives such as [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/en/frontpage) that claim to use increasingly more advanced spaced repetition algorithms, I haven't had a chance to try them out. So, for now, I recommend trying [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) as it is free, has a diverse selection of shared decks (not to mention private, customizable decks), and has several touted learning benefits that I will discuss in-depth in this post.
