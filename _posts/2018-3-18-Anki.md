I first became aware of Anki, the ever-popular open-source spaced repetition flashcard software, back in 2010 after hearing about Roger Craig, the Jeopardy champion who set the record for the highest single-day earnings ever on the show. Apparently, Craig used Anki (along with advanced data mining techniques performed on the show's fan-generated question bank) to memorize information that was most likely to appear during his run. Following Craig's success, use of Anki became the norm for the tech-savvy Jeopardy contestant. At the time, regardless of the burgeoning interest in the software, I didn't take Anki seriously; I thought it was just an isolated use of spaced repetition software that just so happened to benefit a small sub-section of the population, namely game-show contestants. As a result, I never used it in my daily academic routine. I only got re-introduced to Anki after casually looking over the "Pre-Med, Med students, Doctors" section in the course navigation sidebar. After becoming re-acquainted I've come to the realization that Anki is great at ingraining knowledge into my long-term memory for indefinite periods of time, especially if used properly. Although there are paid alternatives such as [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/en/frontpage) that claim to use increasingly more advanced spaced repetition algorithms, I have not had a chance to try them out. So, for now, I recommend trying out [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) as it is free, has a diverse selection of shared decks (not to mention private, customizable decks), and has several touted learning benefits that I will discuss in this post.
