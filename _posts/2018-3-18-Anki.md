title: The Benefits of Anki
published: true
---

I first became aware of Anki, the ever popular open-source spaced repetition software, way back in 2010 after hearing about Roger Craig, the Jeopardy champion who set the record for the highest single-day earnings ever on the show. Apparently, Craig used Anki (along with advanced data mining techniques performed on the show's fan-generated question bank) to memorize information that was most likely to appear on his episode. Following Craig's success, use of Anki became the norm for the tech-savvy Jeopardy contestant. Regardless, at the time, I didn't take Anki seriously; I thought it was just an isolated use of spaced repetition software that just so happened to benefit a small sub-section of the population, namely game-show contestants.
