I first became aware of Anki, the open-source spaced repetition flashcard software, back in 2010 after hearing about [Roger Craig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Craig_(Jeopardy!_contestant)), the Jeopardy champion who set the record for the highest single-day earnings ever. Apparently, Craig used Anki to memorize information that was most likely to appear during his memorable run. Following Craig's success, use of Anki became the norm for the tech-savvy Jeopardy contestant. At the time, regardless of the growing interest in the software, I didn't take Anki seriously; I thought it was just an isolated use of spaced repetition software that just so happened to benefit a small sub-section of the population, namely game-show contestants. As a result, I never used it in my daily academic routine. I only got re-introduced to Anki after looking over the "Pre-Med, Med students, Doctors" section in the course navigation sidebar. After becoming re-acquainted and using it for several weeks, I've realized that Anki is great at ingraining knowledge, bit by bit, into my long-term memory and preserving it there for lengthy periods of time, especially if used properly. Although there are paid alternatives such as [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/en/frontpage) that claim to use increasingly advanced spaced repetition algorithms, I haven't had a chance to try them out. So, for now, I recommend trying [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) as it is free, has a diverse selection of shared decks (not to mention private, customizable decks), and has several touted learning benefits that I'll discuss in-depth in this post.

The learning benefits I'll discuss are with respect to the course content; there may be others that you’ve discovered on your own, which you are free to write about in the comments section below the post. I’ll be examining concepts covered in the lectures, with extraneous research and personal inputs introduced as necessary. In particular, the following concepts will be analyzed: 

- focused and diffuse modes of learning

- [chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology))

- independent learning

- [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method))
 
- testing

- memory

- life-long learning and broadening your passions

## Focused and Diffuse Modes of Learning
Focusing your attention in a familiar thought pattern is easy with Anki. After all, the model the software operates on is spaced repetition. In any given session, you’ll see the same card again and again—spaced out in time intervals that depend on your level of mastery of the flashcard—until you’ve thoroughly mastered its definition or conceptual significance. Once Anki repeats that card after an interval of, say, 10 minutes, you’ll enter the focused mode to recall the familiar thought pattern evoked by that card. But while you’re waiting to be retested on the flashcard you just had, you'll be presented with another flashcard that presents a different word or concept. By interspersing cards that are unique to cards you just encountered, Anki stimulates divergent, unfamiliar thought patterns and neural pathways that are more scattered and variegated. I use words like “unique,” “scattered,” and “variegated” here because though the cards should differ from one another, they should not be wholly unrelated. Unless you’re memorizing something like [GRE vocabulary](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2430987595), they should converge into several umbrellas (or "chunks") of terms that then group into a particular, broad subject. By drawing from this broad pool of terms and testing you on it, Anki should cause you to enter the diffuse mode every time it prompts you with a unseen, unfamiliar card.

A point of contention may be that, according to the lectures, wouldn’t the diffuse mode only be induced when you are in a relaxed state of mind, and not when engaging in a review session? I disagree, for although the lectures and quizzes stress this point, [Dr. Oakley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Oakley) has herself conceded in _A Mind for Numbers_ that “sometimes you may also flicker for a rapid moment to diffuse mode thinking,” going on further to state that “as long as the focused attention is shifted away from the area of interest,” the diffuse mode seems to be elicited. In essence, then, every micro-cycle of familiar to unfamiliar flashcard should prod the mind to “flicker” between the focused and diffuse modes. I'll further argue that, from my own experience, the length of time spent in the diffuse mode need not be limited to a “rapid moment,” but rather depends on how "long the focused attention is shifted away" from the familiar cards. For example, you may spend over 30 seconds on an unfamiliar card, actively searching through broad swathes of your memory for some clue to its meaning. And spending more time on unfamiliar cards is not necessarily bad: it forces you to step away from the main body of familiar cards and ponder, for however long you deem reasonable, the meaning of information yet to be assimilated into your knowledge. In the process, you are actively seeking out information that is well beyond the [rigid framework of ideas](https://books.google.com/books?id=vsGaBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT145&lpg=PT145&dq=rigid+framework+of+thought+patterns&source=bl&ots=3rl6WWJbWi&sig=gYLTUWvLyqQ1TCgr8B3pa6NGmAM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6wqXN3PPZAhUPd6wKHUjQCuoQ6AEIXjAI#v=onepage&q=rigid%20framework%20of%20thought%20patterns&f=false) that has thus far characterized your understanding of the material. The implications of such an approach are profound: continue to do Anki sessions regularly, and the software will reinforce the “brick-and-mortar” foundations of your learning. The importance of enough "mortar," or diffuse mode thinking, cannot be stressed enough; it is this crucial element that binds together the various constituents of our understanding, through the creative intermingling of disparate thought patterns. In this analogy, the familiar flashcards, or “bricks,” induce the focused mode, while the unfamiliar flashcards, or “mortar,” elicit the diffuse mode. Regardless of what subject you decide to review, be sure to recognize and embrace this dualistic nature of the focused and diffuse modes of learning; it will allow you to optimize your performance on the cards and solidify your overall understanding. In summary, Anki may very well be an algorithm-driven manifestation of traditional, "brick-and-mortar" learning.

On a related note, some advice I suggest for you when customizing the settings for a shared or customized deck is to toggle the [“bury related cards until the next day”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/7jw0mv/should_i_bury_related_new_card_to_next_day/) option. Doing so will prevent the re-occurrence of related cards that test the same definition or concept. Especially for shared decks that test the same concept in two different formats (e.g. question-answer format and answer-question format), this option will ensure that you don’t encounter two related flashcards on the same day. Having said this, I think it’s time to move on to the next benefit of Anki.

## Chunking
Anki facilitates [chunking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/11/08/what-makes-chunking-such-an-effective-way-to-learn/#5ccdaf2f60a9) by heavily involving the focused mode of learning. So, what exactly is a chunk? According to Dr. Oakley, a chunk is “a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively.” It is the meaningful neural structure formed when we simplify a set of abstract ideas or an intricate, detailed set of commands into one cohesive concept or seamless action. For the purposes of learning with Anki, I'll only discuss the chunking of mental ideas, rather than physical actions. The three-step method of forming a chunk is as follows: focused attention, understanding, and practice. Gradually, by focusing your attention on a particular flashcard, promoting understanding by allowing you to see the official answer and compare it with your answer, and repeatedly testing a flashcard in a spaced interval determined by your level of mastery of that flashcard, Anki ensures you form chunks efficiently and methodically. What Anki avoids in the process of chunking are illusions of competence, particularly those that arise from a momentary grasp of the material but lack of commitment to long-term memory. By spacing out your recall of the flashcard over lengthy intervals, Anki forces you to remember the concept throughout the session. Such intermittent recall is one of the best ways to learn and embed knowledge in your long-term memory, according to research by psychologist [Jeff Karpicke](https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/psy/directory/faculty/Karpicke_Jeffrey.html) published in the Journal Science. Overall, chunking with spaced repetition software like Anki seems to be one of the central components of learning effectively.

## Learning Independently, Deliberate Practice, and Testing
Perhaps the most obvious benefit of Anki is that it allows meaningful, self-directed learning. A typical session lasts 30 to 40 minutes—perfect for completing a [Pomodoro](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730), which focuses your attention on the task at hand while ignoring distractions and rewarding yourself afterwards. But you can also break up your single review session into briefer sessions that keep your interest stimulated throughout the day. I personally prefer to do one, uninterrupted session in the morning when I am freshest, to get it over with and move on with my day. But if you have time constraints, and the only time you can find is whenever and wherever you have spare time, by all means, go for it. The research, in particular, supports testing in different environments; in Dr. Oakley's "Illusions of Competence" lecture, she states that by learning in various environments, you develop the ability to recall information you studied regardless of where you are at the moment. This fact is key for you to maximize your performance in a test-taking environment, which, unless you've exposed yourself to diverse environments while studying, will affect your ability to recall on exam day. Beyond the flexibility learning independently affords, it also promotes learning that is based on the process rather than the product. As long as we are deeply immersed in the review session, and form a self-perpetuating habit of recalling the meaning of each flashcard, we can curb detriments to learning such as procrastination and goal-oriented thinking. With Anki, forming this good habit is not hard at all. The software, from my experience, is quite addicting, and is even a rudimentary game of sorts. The simple interface, the clickable buttons that allow you rate how well you know each flashcard, and especially the useful, downloadable add-ons such as [Incremental Reading](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1081195335), [Quizlet Importer](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/590899480), and many, many others, have sustained my interest and enlisted my friendly “zombies” to continue doing Anki review sessions once per day. In conclusion, independent learning is a cornerstone of Anki.

Anki fosters deliberate practice and testing with one simple, underlying principle: active recall. Deliberate practice refers to systematic and focused practice that has the aim of improving performance. Inherently, Anki will enable systematic and focused practice by virtue of its user interface and testing methodology: by prompting you to actively recall the meaning of one flashcard at a time for a sustained time period of, say, 30 minutes. But how does Anki improve performance? Here is where Anki's spaced repetition algorithm comes into play. According to the [Anki Manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html), when you press the "show answer" button on front of the flashcard, Anki will show you the definition on the back of the card, along with four buttons. Each of those four buttons corresponds to the level of difficulty with which you perceived the card. "Again," "Hard," "Good," or "Easy" are usually the four options; the choices vary from card to card, with there sometimes being only 2 or 3 choices of difficulty. After you've selected one of the choices, Anki will schedule the card you receive next by order of difficulty. With the use of the [SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm](https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm)—originally developed by SuperMemo—Anki will deploy cards of higher difficulty sooner and consign less difficult cards to the end of the session. By creating an individually tailored schedule of most difficult and least difficult cards, Anki will conceivably improve your understanding of and performance on the cards much faster than a program or tool that did not rely this algorithm. As for testing, Anki relies on active recall sessions to informally quiz you on review material. Dr. Oakley has said in the lectures that testing yourself can be just as valuable as formal, traditional, exam-based testing. With this understanding in mind, we can free ourselves from the notion that learning needs to be a done in a traditional, classroom setting. Tying back to the section on independent learning, with Anki, you can learn just as effectively on your own, in a self-directed manner. Ultimately, deliberate practice and testing are central to the process of learning, and Anki succeeds in incorporating both concepts.

## Memory
The assumption that Anki is conducive to long-term memory is premised upon the facts that Anki promotes active recall, uses spaced repetition, and also that it is “content-agnostic.” Active recall is a form of informal testing that strengthens memories to a very great extent. As Professor Terry Sejnowski has said in the lectures, active recall retrieves and [reactivates](http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/19/9/401.full) old memories from the long-term memory to the short-term and working memory. There are also the reciprocal processes of [consolidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation) and [reconsolidation](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2090), which embed memories from the short-term and working memory to the long-term memory. You may ask, can Anki be used to consolidate memories in the first place? Yes and no. According to cognitive scientists [Smith and Scarf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476736/), "spaced repetitions enhance the consolidation of memories to a greater extent than massed repetitions and providing time for memories to consolidate enhances the consolidation/reconsolidation of additional learning that can be fit into the same framework, resulting in faster learning and better retention." So although Anki can consolidate new information into memories by drilling you on them in spaced intervals, I would like to complicate Smith and Scarf's argument. Based on the lectures, I feel it is better to have a preliminary understanding gained from other contexts before you embark on learning with Anki. If you are in school, then this means attending lecture and taking hand-written notes; doing so will create very firm neural structures that serve as a good foundation for further deliberate practice and active recall with Anki. Conversely, if you are learning a new language outside of the classroom, self-drected learning with Anki may actually be the _first step_ for the consolidation of new words and phrases. In this scenario, though you may engage in further retrieval practice to reconsolidate and reactivate your understanding of the vocabulary, free speech or writing should serve as the final, fluid medium in which you reactivate your newly-learned vocabulary. In this sense, after gaining a preliminary mastery over the meaning of words and phrases, [immersion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immersion) should be reserved for conversations, whether they are face-to-face, written, via phone or video chat, or through online chat rooms or forums. Clearly, there are different circumstances where consolidation, reconsolidation and reactivation are all possible with Anki.

Moving on to the next point, what do I mean by “content-agnosticism?" The [Anki Manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html) clarifies: since Anki “supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities (for customization of these flashcards) are endless.” With such a broad variety of embeddable content, Anki caters to the unique content preferences of each user. And as Dr. Oakley has mentioned in the lectures, because our visual and spatial memory are especially powerful, tailoring content to suit these forms of memory may be especially effective. For example, you may use quirky images or funny videos in your flashcards to further create the “neural hooks” that aid learning. Additionally, add-on features like [image occlusion](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094) and [cloze-deletion](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#cloze), will allow you to test yourself with media such as complex diagrams and fill-in-the-blank questions. You may even be able to use “memory palaces” with these flashcards by, for instance, taking pictures of various rooms in your house or some other familiar place, and then embedding these pictures into your flashcards. Or, you can simply mentally implant the words you are being tested on into various rooms in your house. Whatever helps you to consolidate, reconsolidate, and reactivate your memories is appropriate; it all depends on you. In conclusion, Anki is a tool that greatly enriches the memory processes of consolidation, reconsolidation, and reactivation.

## Life-long Learning and Broadening Your Passions
Beyond the obvious use of making your own flashcards in whichever subject you encounter in your life outside the classroom, [Anki](http://rs.io/anki-tips/) confers you the intangible benefit of habit-forming learning. First, in light of the fact that for many working professionals continuing education is a requirement for licensure or certification, Anki may greatly ease the burden of academic learning, especially for those far removed from academia. Doctors, lawyers, pharmacists, nurses, dentists, teachers, accountants, IT professionals, etc., may all benefit from Anki when studying for their licensure or certification exams. Therefore, the importance of a continuing education, especially one which is facilitated by efficient, memory-enhancing software, cannot be emphasized enough. In addition, I can attest that the intense, structured way of drilling yourself periodically leads to a methodical inculcation of not only concepts and ideas, but also habits that cling to your behavior. What exactly are these habits? I personally find that the more I use Anki, creative ideas flow more easily and active recall tends to occur more easily, more spontaneously, and without excessive effort. For you, some other learning habit may form. The creativity I experience may stem from an increase in fluency with the subject matter. Connecting back to the Dr. Oakley’s lectures, perhaps the appropriate concept that would lend some credibility to what I’m saying is the library of chunks that is formed when individual chunks form connections. The library of chunks would explain the increased creativity and diffuse mode thinking I experience when I use Anki frequently. Continuing on this train of thought, it’s easy to see how this newfound creativity and ability to actively recall information more easily can be applied to language-learning. When it’s time to immerse yourself in a foreign language, creativity is key to forming varied sentences and using novel words in different situations. The ability to actively recall may help in picking up idiosyncrasies in a new language. Keep in mind, though, the learning habits discussed here are made possible only by regular use (at least one session a day) of Anki. In summary, expanding your horizon with life-long learning and by broadening your passions (through language-learning, for example), is an unexpected reward of using Anki.

## Conclusion
